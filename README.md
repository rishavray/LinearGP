# LinearGP
Linear Genetic Programming Library in Java

This library is purely written in Java, fast and flexible, aimed at solving linear regregssion problems through linear genetic programming.

gp.props file contains all the global settings. Edit the file as per your requirements.

Edit the CSVParser.java file to change the name of the headers and the no. columns it is reading.

The population as well as the best program at the end of evolution is serialized into two files. It can be later read and executed for validation purposes.
